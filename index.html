    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Armando Bugarin and I am originally from Denver, CO. Currently I live in Kirkland, WA, and prior to moving out here I lived in Las Vegas for a year. I am married and have a little dog named Ramses.</p>
    
    <p>Previous Job Experience</p>

    <ul>
        <li>My previous working experience prior to this was as a real estate agent. I specialized as a buyer's agent, helping many families achieve their dream of home ownership.
            It was a good experience in the industry, learning to build a business and coordinated with many different third party vendors to close a deal.
            On the tech side, I have a lot of experience working with contract software called CTM. I would draft and submit contracts to buy and sell as well as broker-client contracts.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Education History</p>

        <li>Associates of general studies degree from the Community College of Denver, 2011</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My goal professionally is to become a software engineer. That will give me the opportunity to take care of me and my wife.
        I have always been into tech so it is a desire to make my way into the industry.
        Personally, my goal is to travel to as many countries as possible. I've been to 8 countries so far, so hopefully many more to come.
        Another goal is to learn to play the guitar and piano.</p>
